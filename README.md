<h1 align="center">VS Native</h1>

The objective of this project could be inferred from its name. Yes, we intend to create a fast 'native' port of Visual Studio Code without the heavy luggage of ElectronJS's chromium. We are using React Native Windows & Mac to achieve this.

So far this project is not active at the moment. We have not contributed to it in a long while since we were busy investigating better solutions. There's no doubt React Native had the opportunity to improve during that period and hopefully development will be resumed sometime soon.

If you'd like to contribute feel free to contact us, we'd be delighted.
